      description: |
        This resource describes a <<deviceRole>> Temperature value.
        The temperature describes the current value measured.
        The units is a single value that is one of C, F or K.
        It provides the unit of measurement for the temperature value.
        It is a read-only value that is provided by the server.
        If the units Property is missing the default is Celsius [C].
        The range is an array with min,max values for this temperature on this device.
        If no range is provided the default is +/- MAXINT.

      get:
        description: |
          Retrieves the current temperature value.
          A client can specify the units for the requested temperature by use of a query parameter.
          If no query parameter is provided the server provides its default measure or set value.

              This response is generated by the OIC Server when the client sends:
                A retrieve with q queryParameter indicating a unit that the server does not support.
              The server responds with the current resource representation including the
              units property illustrating the supported units and the error.
